    <p><i>Interesting facts about flying-cicada</i></p>
    <ul>
        <li> The body of a cicada is similar to that of a violin or a guitar, in that much of it consists of empty, air-filled spaces that act like a resonating chamber and amplify the sound they generate.</li>
        <li>The loud noise we hear is the male’s mating call—females are silent,” Hall says. “Some species produce that loud whirl that we hear around here, while others make more of a soft clicking sound. Each species of cicada has its own mating call, which can range from soft clicking to loud buzzing.</li>
        <li>Cicadas make noise like toy frogs.</li>
